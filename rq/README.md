Building my own database query engine.

I learned how to write a query engine from [this book]((http://leanpub.com/how-query-engines-work)).

Also, I refer to the code in [kquery](https://github.com/andygrove/how-query-engines-work) and [arrow-datafusion](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion). Thanks for these great projects.
